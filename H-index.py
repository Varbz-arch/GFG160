# You are given an array citations[], where each element citations[i] 
# represents the number of citations received by the ith paper of a researcher. 
# You have to calculate the researcherâ€™s H-index.
# The H-index is defined as the maximum value H, 
# such that the researcher has published at least H papers, 
# and all those papers have citation value greater than or equal to H.
# Input: citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are at least 3 papers with citation counts of 3, 5, and 3, 
# all having citations greater than or equal to 3.
